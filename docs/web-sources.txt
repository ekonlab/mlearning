  """This book is concerned with the nuts and bolts of manipulating, processing, cleaning,
and crunching data in Python. It is also a practical, modern introduction to scientific
computing in Python, tailored for data-intensive applications. This is a book about the
parts of the Python language and libraries you’ll need to effectively solve a broad set of
data analysis problems. This book is not an exposition on analytical methods using
Python as the implementation language"""
